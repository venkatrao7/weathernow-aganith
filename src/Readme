## 📝 Summary  
**WeatherNow** is a lightweight React web application that displays real-time weather for any city using **Open-Meteo APIs** (Geocoding + Current Weather).  
It features a clean, responsive UI and works without any API keys.

---

## ✨ Features  
✅ Search for any city by name  
✅ Displays temperature (°C), wind speed (km/h), and local time  
✅ Handles errors gracefully (empty input, city not found, network issues)  
✅ Responsive design for both desktop and mobile  
✅ No authentication or API key required

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Framework:** React (Vite template)  
- **Styling:** Plain CSS (responsive layout)  
- **APIs Used:**  
  - [Open-Meteo Geocoding API](https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name={city})  
  - [Open-Meteo Weather Forecast API](https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude={lat}&longitude={lon}&current_weather=true)  

---

## 🔍 How It Works  
1. The user enters a city name (e.g., `Hyderabad`).  
2. The app calls the **Geocoding API** to fetch the latitude and longitude.  
3. Using those coordinates, it calls the **Weather API** to fetch the current temperature, wind speed, and time.  
4. The results are displayed neatly in a weather card.
